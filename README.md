# Open-WebUI Electron App

The **Open-WebUI Electron App** transforms the [Open-WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) web application into a standalone desktop application. Built using [Electron.js](https://www.electronjs.org/), this app allows users to access Open-WebUI services directly from their desktop without needing a browser and Docker. **Ollama** is mandatory for this application to function and must be installed separately. For more information about Ollama, visit their [official website](https://ollama.ai/).

This app is designed to work seamlessly with **Open-WebUI v0.4.7** and provides a convenient and streamlined user experience across macOS, Linux, and Windows platforms.
